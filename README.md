## Installation

1. Download the plugin files
2. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Usage

### Adding the Form to Your Site

Use the shortcode `[jovi_feedback_form]` in any post, page, or widget area where you want the feedback form to appear.

### Managing Submissions

1. Access the feedback submissions through the 'Jovi Feedback' menu item in your WordPress admin panel
2. View all submissions in a list with status indicators
3. Click 'View' to see the full submission details
4. Delete submissions as needed

### Theme Integration

The plugin uses CSS variables for colors and styling, making it compatible with your theme's color scheme. The following variables are used:

- `--wp--preset--color--background`
- `--wp--preset--color--contrast`
- `--wp--preset--color--primary`
- `--wp--preset--color--primary-dark`

If your theme doesn't define these variables, the plugin will use fallback colors.
